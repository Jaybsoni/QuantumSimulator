# QuantumSimulator (qsim)

Quantum computers are at the forefront of technology today. They bring with them the promise of huge computational power, enough to rival even the fastest super computers we have today. While these idealistic, fault-tolarent quantum computers are still out of reach we can simulate how they would behave on classical computers today (with sufficient classical resources). In this repo I create a python library to simulate a quantum computer and compare my results with IBM's platform Qiskit.

## Getting started with Qsim 

Simply clone this repository locally, open a terminal in this folder and install it using the command:    `pip install -e .`
